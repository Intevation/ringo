Welcome to Ringo's documentation!
=================================
Ringo is a small Python based high level web application framework build with
Pyramid. Ringo tries to make it very easy to build form based web application
to manage your data. Because ringo provides many basic features which are
often used in modern webapplications it greatly speeds up development. But it
is also flexible and offers many ways to configure the layout, behaviour and
workflow of your application.

The parts of ringo including its core, libraries and extensions are available on `Github <https://github.com/ringo-framework>`_.
